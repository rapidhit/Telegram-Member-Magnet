# PEER_FLOOD: Understanding Telegram Rate Limits

## What is PEER_FLOOD?

PEER_FLOOD is Telegram's protection mechanism against spam and abuse. When you try to add too many members too quickly, Telegram temporarily restricts your account from sending more invitations.

## Why This Happens

- **Telegram's Security**: Prevents spam and protects users from unwanted additions
- **Account Protection**: Prevents your account from being flagged or banned
- **Rate Limiting**: Telegram limits how many users you can invite per hour/day

## Current Success Patterns

From the logs, we can see:
- ‚úÖ **Contact-based invitations work reliably** (users in your contacts)
- ‚ùå **Direct invitations hit rate limits** after initial successful additions
- üìä **Success rate**: About 16 out of 30 attempts before rate limiting kicks in

## How the System Handles It

1. **Automatic Detection**: System detects PEER_FLOOD errors immediately
2. **Auto-Pause**: Job automatically pauses to prevent further restrictions
3. **Protection**: Prevents your account from being temporarily banned
4. **Resume Option**: You can resume after waiting 15+ minutes

## Best Practices for Higher Success Rates

### 1. Use Contact-Based Members
- Add users who are already in your Telegram contacts
- These have the highest success rate (nearly 100%)
- Use the Contact Helper tool to export your contacts

### 2. Optimal Timing
- Wait 15-30 minutes between batches
- Add members during off-peak hours
- Spread additions across multiple days

### 3. Member Preparation
- Focus on @usernames rather than numeric IDs
- Ensure users have interacted with your account before
- Use members from channels you both belong to

### 4. Rate Limiting Settings
- Use conservative settings: 2-3 additions per minute
- Set longer batch delays: 5+ minutes between batches
- Process smaller batches (50-100 users at a time)

## Current System Improvements

‚úÖ **Enhanced Error Handling**: Auto-pauses on PEER_FLOOD
‚úÖ **Extended Delays**: 15-second minimum between invitations  
‚úÖ **Batch Protection**: 5-minute delays between batches
‚úÖ **Success Verification**: Accurate tracking of actual additions

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Extract Contacts**: Use Contact Helper to get reliable user list
2. **Small Batches**: Process 20-50 members at a time
3. **Wait Periods**: 15+ minutes between sessions
4. **Monitor Progress**: Watch for auto-pause notifications
5. **Resume Carefully**: Wait adequate time before resuming

## Alternative Approaches

- **Manual Collection**: Collect usernames from public channels
- **Contact Building**: Build your contact list first
- **Multiple Sessions**: Spread work across several days
- **Account Rotation**: Use multiple accounts (if available)
