# Rate Limit Recovery Guide

## Current Status
Your Telegram account has been rate limited due to too many invitation attempts.

## What Happened
Telegram detected unusual activity (bulk invitations) and temporarily restricted your account.
Current wait time: ~11.6 hours

## Recovery Steps

### Option 1: Wait It Out
- Wait the full rate limit period (~11.6 hours)
- Do not attempt any more invitations during this time
- Rate limits reset automatically after the wait period

### Option 2: Use Different Approach
- Extract members from channels you admin (no rate limits)
- Use Contact Helper to get your accessible contacts
- Manual collection from channels where you can see members

### Option 3: Account Rotation
- Connect additional Telegram accounts
- Distribute invitations across multiple accounts
- Each account has separate rate limits

## Prevention
- Use longer delays between invitations (10-15 seconds minimum)
- Process smaller batches (10-50 users max)
- Only use accessible/known contacts for higher success rates
